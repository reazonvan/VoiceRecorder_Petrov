Voice Recorder (Course Project)
==============================

Author: Ivan Petrov

Overview
--------
This is a simple voice recorder app built with .NET MAUI.
It can record audio from the microphone, save recordings locally, play them back, and delete them.

How it works (short)
--------------------
- Audio files are stored in the app's data folder:
  AppDataDirectory/Recordings
- Metadata about recordings is stored in:
  AppDataDirectory/recordings.json

Project structure
-----------------
- VoiceRecorder_Petrov/MainPage.xaml(.cs): main screen (record button + list of recordings)
- VoiceRecorder_Petrov/PlayerPage.xaml(.cs): playback screen for one recording
- VoiceRecorder_Petrov/Services/AudioService.cs: save/load/delete/play logic
- VoiceRecorder_Petrov/Models/AudioRecording.cs: recording model (metadata + formatted properties for UI)

Platform notes
--------------
- Android: recording uses MediaRecorder; playback uses MediaPlayer for reliable stop/start.
- Other platforms: recording uses Plugin.AudioRecorder; playback uses AudioPlayer from the same plugin.

Run
---
1) Open the solution in Visual Studio 2022.
2) Select target platform (Android or Windows).
3) Build and Run (F5).

Permissions
-----------
- Microphone: required for recording.
